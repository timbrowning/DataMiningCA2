# DataMining

Assessment Brief
Part 1: The first step is to determine the missing values of “Income” that are actually equal to 0. To do this, you are required to define a new variable, say “Binary_Income” with 0, 1 and missing values, for the cases which have 0, non-zero and missing values in the “Income” variable, respectively.	3
*Part 2: Then use the cases with “Binary_Income” equal to either 0 or 1, to develop a logistic regression model. (Report P1)	4
Part 3: The outcome of this model would allow you to predict the missing values in the “Binary_Income” variable, as 0 or 1.	4
Part 4: For any case which “Binary_Income” is predicted as 0, put the actual “Income” equal to 0 as well.	5
*Part 5: Those cases who their “Binary_Income” is predicted as 1, are used along with other cases with nonzero “Income” to develop a linear regression model. (Report P1)	5
Part6: In R file	6
*Report 2: The number of cases with predicted “Binary_Income” as either 0 or 1.	6
*Report 3: The Mean and SD for the non-zero predicted “Income”.	6
